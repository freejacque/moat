# Question 2:
# Investigate Moat Ad Search (http://moat.com) and tell us about all of its
# functionality from a user's perspective. Also please explain how you would
# test those features manually: the sorts of bugs you would look for and some
# of the test cases you would go through. We are not asking for bug reports,
# just thoughts about how you would validate the behavior of the site and try
# to break it. You can either do a deep dive describing how you would test a
# particular feature or tell us in broad terms how you would test the siteâ€™s
# many features.
